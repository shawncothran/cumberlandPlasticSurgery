    <div class="modal">
      <p class="paragraph">BOTOX® Cosmetic is a simple, non-surgical, physician-administered treatment that can temporarily smooth moderate to severe frown lines between the brows in people from 18 to 65 years of age. It is the only treatment of its type approved
        by the FDA. BOTOX® is also used as a facial filler in other areas of the face including the lips.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">One 10-minute treatment—a few tiny injections—and within days there's a noticeable improvement in moderate to severe frown lines between the brows, which can last up to 4 months.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">BOTOX® use in cosmetic medicine has proven highly satisfactory for most users. In clinical trials, nearly 90% of men and women surveyed rated the improvement in the appearance of frown lines between their brows as moderate to better 1
        month after treatment.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">BOTOX® Cosmetic was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 and almost 3.3 million procedures were performed in 2005 alone.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery ranked BOTOX® Cosmetic as the most popular physician-administered aesthetic procedure in the United States for the fourth year in a row (surgical and non-surgical combined).</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The day of your appointment, allow time before your appointment for filling out forms and for consulting with the Dr., Rosdeutscher or a member of the staff. We will discuss your expectations for treatment and if you have any allergiesor
        any condition that wouldn't make you a good candidate for BOTOX® Cosmetic.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The entire BOTOX® Cosmetic injection procedure takes approximately 10 minutes. After the procedure, there's no recovery time needed. You're ready to get on with your day!</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Within a few days you should notice an improvement in the moderate to severe frown lines between your brows or enhanced shape of your lips that can last up to 4 months. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph">Dysport is a simple, effective, non-surgical treatment that works by relaxing facial muscles on the forehead, thereby reducing and smoothing away frown-lines and wrinkles.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The FDA has approved Dysport to treat forehead wrinkles and frown lines, making it only the second drug to be approved by the agency as a wrinkle treatment. Dysport is made from the same active ingredient as Botox, Clostridium botulinimtoxin
        type A. Botulinum toxins temporarily reduce the appearance of wrinkles by restricting the muscle actions that cause creasing and frown lines.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Like Botox, Dysport is administered via an injection at the site of forehead wrinkles. The FDA based its approval on clinical trials involving about 2,900 people at 80 study sites. One clinical trial showed 93%-95% of participants noticedan
        improvement in the appearance of forehead wrinkles within seven days after treatment, and multiple treatments produced effects that lasted for more than 13 months.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Whenever you laugh, frown, concentrate or squint into the sun, your facial muscles contract and your skin creases. As you get older your skin loses its elasticity and those creases deepen into lines that become permanently etched on yourface.
        Frown lines between your eyes can become particularly noticeable at a relatively young age, making you look angry or worried even when you’re not.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">By temporarily immobilizing the muscles you use to frown, Dysport can smooth out those lines, restoring a more youthful, less stressed expression to your face. Because you will be physically unable to frown after treatment, you may evenlose
        the urge to frown. The lasting effect of treatment with Dysport can differ between individuals after which further courses of treatment may be necessary. Speak with your specialist about the results you can expect with Dysport.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Many people find after several treatments that they don’t need another one for longer, because they have “unlearned” the habit of frowning or squinting that originally led to the development of these lines.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Tiny amounts of Dysport are injected directly into the facial muscles underlying the frown lines. It usually takes three to five small, almost painless injections between the eyebrows for an effective treatment. Over the next few days,the
        muscles gradually relax. You probably won’t notice it happening – you’ll just become aware that you can’t contract your frown muscles. But because you can still blink normally and raise your eyebrows, you will not look unnatural.Rather,
        you can enjoy a more youthful appearance while maintaining a natural expression.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Deeply etched frown lines affect not just your appearance, but also your self-esteem and even your choice of career. Dysport can help you look younger, more relaxed and in control – for around the same price per month as a cut and colorby
        your hairdresser.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Many people with frown lines can benefit from Dysport – and it can work as well for men as it does for women. In fact many men are already experiencing the benefits of a younger, more relaxed looking appearance that Dysport can provide.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Along with its desired effects, treatments can cause unwanted effects. This does not happen very often. The most common side effects are temporary soreness or mild bruising around the injection site. Some people may experience a slightheadache
        that lasts for several hours after treatment; it is safe to take a mild pain killer to relieve this.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In a very small percentage of cases there can be a complication called "ptosis" (a drooping eyelid) which may last a few days or up to 4 weeks. Rarely, an allergic reaction can cause a skin rash or "flu like" symptoms.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">You should not have Dysport treatment while you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or at all if you have a neuromuscular disease. </p>

      <p class="paragraph">Approved by the FDA, Juvéderm injectable gel is a “next-generation” facial filler, lip augmentation, cheek augmentation &amp; lift. The smooth consistency gel helps to instantly restore your skin's volume and smooth away facial wrinkles
        and folds, like your "smile lines" or “parentheses”(nasolabial folds—the creases that run from the bottom of your nose to the corners of your mouth).</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Juvéderm™ is a smooth consistency gel made of hyaluronic acid — a naturally occurring substance in your skin that helps to add volume and hydration. Juvéderm™ injectable gel is gently injected under the skin to provide a smooth, naturallook

      <p class="paragraph">In fact, studies show superior results of Juvéderm™ compared to a collagen-based dermal filler. And, almost 90% of all study volunteers who were treated with both Juvéderm™ injectable gel and another dermal filler preferred Juvéderm™.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In addition, Juvéderm™ injectable gel is the first FDA-approved hyaluronic acid dermal filler that is proven to be safe and effective for persons of color.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">With Juvéderm™ the injection process takes only about 15 minutes and results are immediate. Because Juvéderm™ injectable gel is a simple, nonsurgical treatment, there is minimal recovery or downtime. So you can make an appointment for
        treatmentand get right back to your life.</p>

        elasticity and loss of natural skin hydration.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The Obagi Nu-Derm System, a physician-prescribed skin care system, accelerates the cellular turnover. This System penetrates deep to improve damage in layers of the skin. It boosts functions of the skin at the cellular level to improveskin's
        cellular function to help it look and act younger and healthier. The System triggers our Therapeutic Cascade™ of actions that:</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Pushes fresher cells to the surface faster, for smoother skin, reduced wrinkles and increased tolerance. Reduces mottled pigmentation (freckles and age spots) and helps prevent the appearance of new pigmentation Promotes more uniform cells
        at the deepestlayer for better skin structure and balanced, more even skin tone Helps increase collagen and elastin for firmer, more resilient looking skin Increases nutrients natural hydration and circulation for supple, healthy-looking
        skin</p>

        including patient age, skin type, amount of damage and daily compliance.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The damaged top layer of skin is replaced by a new layer of fresh, healthy skin cells. This process takes approximately 6 weeks. During this phase, you can expect to experience one or more of these symptoms:</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Your freckles, age spots and dark patches begin fading Exfoliation and flaking Redness and dryness Wrinkles and acne may look worse temporarily. These reactions are indications that the treatment is working. It is absolutely necessary to stay with the program to see these results.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">As stimulation continues, you begin to notice significant improvements in your skin. New skin cells continue reaching the surface and the production of collagen and elastin increases. Expect to notice:</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Wrinkles begin to reduce Tightening of your pores Further lightening of your freckles, age spots and dark patches Subsiding redness and flaking</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Your friends will begin to notice your skin. Your skin will look and act younger and healthier. Your skin is firmer and more resilient More even color tone Smooth and naturally hydrated</p>

      <p class="paragraph">The active ingredient in Latisse is bimatoprost, a compound derived from fatty acids that bind to receptors in the eyelashes that may be involved in the development and re-growth of hair follicles. Allergan, the manufacturer of Latisse
        hasused bimatoprost since 2001 in Lumigan, an Rx eye drop that lowers eye pressure in people with glaucoma. (Glaucoma is a disease that may cause vision loss from damage to the optic nerve if too much pressure builds up in the eye.)</p>
