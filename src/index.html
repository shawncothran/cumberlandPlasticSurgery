        <h2>
          What does "Board Certified" mean?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A Board Certified Plastic Surgeon has achieved the highest standards of training requirements of the American Board of Plastic Surgery, the only group recognized for certification in plastic surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, any licensed physician can practice as a plastic, cosmetic or aesthetic surgeon, even without meeting the necessary requirements which qualify the physician to be Board Certified. Since most cosmetic operations can be performed in a doctor's office, the American Medical Association has little control over this. Any other "board" with the words "plastic" or "cosmetic" in its title is not recognized as an acceptable certifying organization by the American Board of Medical Specialties, the only authority that can approve a board in the United States.
